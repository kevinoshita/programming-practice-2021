# Exercise 8 - Playing with Deep Neural Networks

Task 1 - Create a deep learning model. Train and test it on CIFAR. Report the accuracy and testing accuracy.

Task 2 - Report the accuracy of the same model learned on CIFAR in a slightly modified CIFAR dataset. This dataset has some sort of noise added to it.

Task 3 - Train on this new dataset with noise and report the results (accuracy and testing accuracy).
